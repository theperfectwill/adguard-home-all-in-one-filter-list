@Todo->add new lists used in README file
- Removed phishing-filter, compiler failed everytime
- Removed a no-add.com kind of site because the ip resolved failed

@ToDo->add compiled whitelist

@ToDo->probably separate the compiled list into some basic categories
- like malware/phishing/badhosts, spam/gambling, analytics/trackers, ads, etc.
